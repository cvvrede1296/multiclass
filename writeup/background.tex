\subsection{Multiquadratic Fields}
\begin{mydef}
Let $d$ be squarefree integer $d$ other than 1.
The field

\[\mathcal{K} = \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{d}] = \{x + y\sqrt{d}: x,y \in \mathbb{Q},\}\]

is called a quadratic field and has degree 2 over $\QQ$.
\end{mydef}

These fields have all have signature $(2,0)$ and therefore the
unit group of any order in $\mathcal{K}$ is finitely generated
by 1 generator of infinite order.
This unit can be computed efficiently using the continued fraction method(see~\cite{Cohen:1995:CCA:206777}).
For the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_\calK$ of a field $\calK$,
we denote its the unit group by $\mathcal{O}^\times_\calK$.
For a quadratic field this group is isomorphic to $\mu(\mathcal{O})\times\mathbb{Z}$
and generated by the fundamental unit $\epsilon$.
Here $\mu(\mathcal{O})$ is the finite cyclic group of roots of unity in
$\mathcal{O}$.

\begin{mydef}
Let $\Lprime 1, \Lprime 2, \dots, \Lprime n$ be squarefree integers that are multiplicatively
independent modulo squares (i.e. they are independent in $\mathbb{Q}^\times/
(\mathbb{Q}^\times)^2)$.
The field

\[\LL = \fieldn ,\]

is called a multiquadratic field and has degree $N = 2^n$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.
Its Galois group ${\rm Gal}(\LL\slash\QQ)$ is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$.
\end{mydef}


\subsection{Class Groups}
\subsection{How to Compute Class Groups}
\begin{mydef}[relations]
We denote the \textit{relation} of a field $\LL$ 
of the principal ideal $(\alpha)$ as $\rel \LL {(\alpha)}$.
$\rel \LL {(\alpha)} = (\alpha, \vec e)$ if and only if 
$$
(\alpha) = \prod_{1\leq i \leq B} \mathfrak{p}_i^{e_i},
$$
where $\mathfrak{p}_i$ are prime ideals of $\LL$.
The relations of $\LL$ form a multiplicative group;
a minimal set that forms the basis of this group is denoted by $\rels \LL$.
\end{mydef}
